Make sure you're updated to the new stable SteamOS  that allows for custom boot videos with no tweaking:

1. Switch to desktop mode
2. Open 'Home" in your file explorer (it's called Dolphin)
3. Press the three lines in the top right and choose "Show Hidden Files"
4. Go to ~/.steam/root/config/
5. Create a new folder called "uioverrides", and in that folder create another folder called "movies"
6. From my google drive, download the deck_startup.webm of the intro movie you want to use as your boot video, and move it into the folder you just created under ~/.steam/root/config/uioverrides/movies/ 
7. You're done! Buy me a coffee if you want to! Paypal: https://paypal.me/tghazaly?country.x=US&locale.x=en_US
